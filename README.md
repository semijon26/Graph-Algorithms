# Graph-Algorithms

1. A graph data structure (adjacency list)
  - with and without weighting
  - uni- and bidirectional
  - nodes and edges, as well as corresponding operations
    
2. Algorithms distributed across 7 tasks:
  - "Road construction": Prim
  - "Water supply": Ford-Fulkerson
  - "Fireworks": Dijkstra
  - "Wedding couples": Ford-Fulkerson
  - "Postman": Hierholzer
  - "Road traffic": Ford-Fulkerson
  - "Work distribution": Ford-Fulkerson

3. Opportunity to calculate own examples via console input
